# Integer/String Conversions

## Problem

Write two conversion routines.
The first routine converts a string to a signed integer. You may assume that the string contains only digits and the minus character('-'), that is a properly formatted integer number, and that the number is within the range of an `int` type.
The second routine converts a signed integer stored as an `int` back to as string.

## Analysis
Every language has library routines to do these conversions.
For example, in C# the `Convert.ToInt32()` and `Convert.ToString()` methods are available. Java uses the `Integer.parseInt()` and `Integer.toString()` methods.
