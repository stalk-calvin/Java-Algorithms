# Permutations of a String

## Problem

Implement a routine that prints all possible orderings of the characters in a string.
In other words, print all permutations that use all the characters from the original string.
For example, given the string "hat", your function should print the string "tha", "aht", "tah", "ath", "hat".
Treat each character in the input string as a distinct character, even if it is repeated.
Given the string "aaa", your routine should print "aaa" six times.
You may print the permutaions in any order you choose.

## Analysis

Take "hat" for example,
