## Approaches to Programming Problems

How you handle a probelm when you don't immediately see the solution.

## The Process
Most important part of the interview.
Determine how well you can code.

### The Scenario

one-to-one

white-board(pen/paper)

talk throught the question before starting writing

### The Problems


### Which Languages to Use


### Interactivity is Key


## Solving the Problems

### The Basic Steps

1. Make sure you understand the problem.

2. When you understand the question, try a simple example.

3. Focus on the algorithm and data structures you will use to solve the problem(Interactivity is important during the process).

4. After you figure out your algorithm and how you can implement it, explian your solution to the interviewer.

5. While you code, explian what you're doing.

6. Ask questions when necessary.

7. After you write the code for a problem, immediately verify that the code works by tracing through it with an example.

8. Make sure you check your code for all error and special cases, especially boundary conditions.

### When You Get Stuck

* Go back to an example.

* Try a different data structure.

* Consider the less-commonly used or more-advanced aspects of a language.

## Analyzing Your Solution

Runtime and memory usage analysis.

### Big-O Analysis in Action

### How Big-O Analysis Works

### Best, Average, and Worst Cases

### Optimizations and Big-O Analysis

### How to do Big-O Analysis

1. Figure out what the input is and what n represents.

2. Express the number of operations the algorithm performs in terms of n.

3.  Eliminate all but the highest-order terms.

4. Remove all constant factors.


### Which Algorithm is Better?

    O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^c) < O(c^n) < O(n!)

### Memory Footprint Analysis
